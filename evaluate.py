To Do:
1. Figure out how to convert PGN or FPG from the lichess database into the (x,y) -> (hex representation of the board state, eval)
2. Build out an excel file via an automation process for every game state 
    (we are looking at 10's of thousands of games since each month is 30gb of data)3
3. Use the data to train a conv net <- this is a later problem

# you'll want to use pandas 
import pandas as pd

def pgn_to_hex():
    return "unimplemented"
